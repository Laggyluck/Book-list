Application allows to add book that we read, update and delete it. We can also see all books we've added. It uses SQLite to store a data. 
To add book we need to pass a title, author, number of pages, ISBN number (International Standard Book Number) and rate how much we 
enjoyed reading it. Application validates (by using regex) the ISBN number that we want to pass. 

Examples of valid ISBNs:

ISBN 978-0-596-52068-7 

ISBN-13: 978-0-596-52068-7

978 0 596 52068 7

9780596520687

ISBN-10 0-596-52068-9

0-596-52068-9
